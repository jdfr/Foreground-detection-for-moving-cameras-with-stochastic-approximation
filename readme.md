# Foreground detection for moving cameras with stochastic approximation

Original code for the paper entitled **Foreground detection for moving cameras with stochastic approximation**,
by Francisco-Javier López-Rubio and Ezequiel López-Rubio. Example data and pre-built OpenCV DLLs not included.
These can be found at [Ezequiel's research webpage](http://www.lcc.uma.es/~ezeqlr/nonpan/nonpan.html).

Dependencies:
* Matlab for Windows, unknown version between R2013a and R2015b
* OpenCV-2.4.8, the last version before the nonfree module was moved to OpenCV-contrib.
  Not sure if OpenCV was built from source or it was a stock binary version downloaded from somewhere...
* Intel's TBB
* Eigen, the C++ matrix header-only library
